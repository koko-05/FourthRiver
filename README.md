My goal is to create a pixel art renderer and creator, allowing you to modify vertex data and object data, with a custom Material system and everything.
Basically a game engine or a blender clone, but for pixel art. This will be the basis for what I will construct in the future, and while I develop the PixelArtCreator
I'll propably change/add/remove features from this.

For Now, there are a ton of things that I havent implemented:

TODO:
  - ~~Basic OpenGL Infrastructure ( VBO, VAO, IBO, Shaders, Textures, etc )~~
  - ~~Basic Engine ( MVP )~~ Need To Optimize!
  - ~~Component Infrastructure~~
  - ~~Load Mesh from .obj file~~
    - ~~Add groups~~
  - Add pivots for Transform Component
  - Dynamic allocation for components
  - Materials ( Further Shader and Texture abstraction )
      - Pixel Art shader, etc
  - Batch rendering support
  - Proper UI support ( fixed position, scales with window size )
  - I'll add more things later
